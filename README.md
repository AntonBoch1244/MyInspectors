# MyInspectors

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that makes it so when you open a slot in an inspector panel, you will generate the content instead of the host.<br>
When creating a new inspector the initial slot's content will not be generated by you, instead you need to select a different slot then select the one you want to inspect again for all your stuff to generate. I wish I could fix this but I don't know how.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [MyInspectors.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/MyInspectors/releases/latest/download/MyInspectors.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
